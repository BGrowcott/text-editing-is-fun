## Usage

The application uses Webpack, IndexedDB and service worker to create a PWA that you can download and use offline. 

- Opening the application in the browser IndexedDB creates a database storage.
- Content in the text editor is saved when clicking off the DOM window and retrieved on reopening it after it's been closed.
- Clocking the install button will download the application as an icon on the desktop and allow the user to use it offline.
